<div class="body-text">
 <p>
	&emsp; Dynamic Threat Management is a Virginia based 
	Security/Executive Protection Consulting and Protective 
	Services company. In response to a growing need for 
	specialized products for low profile and concealment work, 
	we opened an in-house shop to design and build systems to 
	meet the needs we faced in the work place.

<p>  
   &emsp;  This shop has grown rapidly into a commercial endeavor 
	as others have brought their job specific requirements to us,
	to design covert solutions for previously overt work. This is 
	increasingly valuable as operational environments and public 
	perceptions continue to shift and evolve.

<p>   
	&emsp; Composed of experienced private sector, military, and law
	enforcement specialists, all with critical incident experience,
	we provide our customers with the best in risk management options.
	Every product we produce has been directly influenced by 35 years 
	of cumulative real world experience. 

<p>	
	&emsp; Each design undergoes range testing and real world  product testing prior
	to release to the public. We employ a specialized team of highly experienced
	prior LE/MIL that evaluates every system at all product phases prior to release. 

<p>
	&emsp; We offer individual custom holsters and products made to you specifications,
	or your may select from our pre-designed models.
